# Smart Home Voice Assistant

This is a Python program that acts as a voice-controlled smart home assistant. It allows users to control doors, lights, and set the temperature using voice commands.

## Features

### 1. Voice Interaction

The assistant can understand and respond to voice commands. It utilizes the `pyttsx3` library for text-to-speech conversion and `speech_recognition` for speech recognition.

### 2. Adding Doors and Lights

Users can add new doors and lights to the smart home system by specifying the name of the door or light they want to add.

Example command: "Adding a door named garage door."

### 3. Opening and Closing Doors

The assistant can open and close doors based on user commands. It interacts with the `Door` class to perform these actions.

Example command: "Open the garage door."

### 4. Turning On and Off Lights

Users can control the lights by turning them on and off. The assistant interacts with the `Light` class to manage the lights.

Example command: "Turn on the kitchen light."

### 5. Setting Temperature

Users can set the temperature of the smart home. The default temperature is 25Â°C.

Example command: "Set the temperature to 22 degrees."

### 6. Exiting the Program

Users can exit the program by saying "bye." This command terminates the execution of the assistant.

Example command: "Goodbye."


2. Speak commands to interact with the smart home assistant.
